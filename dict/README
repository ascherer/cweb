The "words" file contains about 110,000 English words including derived
forms, with American spelling. The "british" file is a supplement
of about 10,000 words with British spelling. Both files are in
lexicographic order by ASCII code except that lowercase letters
are mapped to be the same as uppercase.

I compiled these files for use with the "kspell" routine
(found in the examples directory of the CWEB distribution).
Several dictionaries compiled by Geoff Kuenning for "ispell" served
as the starting point, but I made extensive additions and deletions.
I don't plan to maintain these files in any way; they are just
intended as starting points for people who want to try kspell and
build their own dictionaries; kspell's "wordtest" routine
is able to merge many dictionaries together easily and quickly.

Feel free to use these files for any noncommercial purpose. If you
use them in a product, I think you should get permission from
geoff@ITcorp.com first, since 90% of the words were culled from
his files. -- Don Knuth
