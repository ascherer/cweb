Edit by Nelson H. F. Beebe <beebe@plot79.math.utah.edu>

The master sources for cweb are now maintained by Silvio Levy and Don
Knuth in labrea.stanford.edu:pub/cweb.

I have added the sample subdirectory with Cameron Smith's
calculator-in-web example, taken from
niord.shsu.edu:[fileserv.kr-cweb-sample]krcwsamp.zip.

I have also added the subdirectory dict with the dictionaries
mentioned in example/README, taken from labrea.stanford.edu:pub/dict.
