# cweb 4.1

people have been accumulating several decades of experience with
[cweb](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/cweb.html), and we know that
ctangle and cweave work reasonably well on numerous platforms. in general those
programs are now entirely stable: don knuth won't be changing them any more,
because they've proved their value in extensive use.  (henceforth he must
devote full time to the art of computer programming!)

however, further significant developments, including versions that don himself
does not maintain, are ongoing. all of the really current news about cweb is,
in fact, now to be found in this cweb development project.

# software archæology

besides for further development, this ‘project’ is used as an – obviously
incomplete – repository of original release versions of levy/knuth
[cweb](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/cweb.html). you can either
compile these sources directly or stick the recent version “cweb-4.1” into my
[cwebbin](https://github.com/ascherer/cwebbin), which introduces convenient
extensions and prepares cweb for inclusion in the “tex live” distribution.

## call for help

recently i spotted versions 2.7 and 2.8 in
[utah](http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/pub/cweb/) – and there's even "the"
[original cweb 2.8](ftp://ftp.cs.stanford.edu/pub/cweb2.8) in stanford –, but
the intermediate versions 3.0 and 3.1 are still missing in my collection. i
could scrape them from
[amiga](ftp://91.204.149.69/Amiga/CD%20images/Aminet%20Set/1%20(Jan%201995)/AMINET/DEV/C/)
a/o [atari
archives](ftp://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/CTAN/systems/atari/lindner-tex/cweb-3.0-1.2.zoo),
but i'd rather have the respective originals. in case you can direct me to
appropriate archive servers, i'd be really grateful.
