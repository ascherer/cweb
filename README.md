# software archæology

this ‘project’ serves as an – obviously incomplete – repository of original
release versions of levy/knuth
[cweb](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/cweb.html). Instead of compiling
these sources directly – which will give a significant amount of compiler
warnings – i stick the recent version “cweb-3.64b” into my
[cwebbin](https://github.com/ascherer/cwebbin), fix all problems with a set of
“change files” and introduce convenient extensions.

## call for help

recently i spotted versions 2.7 and 2.8 in
[utah](http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/pub/cweb/) – and there's even "the"
[original cweb 2.8](ftp://ftp.cs.stanford.edu/pub/cweb2.8) in stanford –, but
the intermediate versions 3.0 and 3.1 are still missing in my collection. i
could scrape them from
[amiga](ftp://91.204.149.69/Amiga/CD%20images/Aminet%20Set/1%20(Jan%201995)/AMINET/DEV/C/)
a/o [atari
archives](ftp://ftp.cstug.cz/pub/CTAN/systems/atari/lindner-tex/cweb-3.0-1.2.zoo),
but i'd rather have the respective originals. in case you can direct me to
appropriate archive servers, i'd be really grateful.
